# My dotfiles

This is my current dotfiles repository.

To install these you can run the following command:

```sh
./install.sh
```

## Requirements

For installation, you need `stow` program.

Mentoined programs:
- `rofi`
- `niri`
- `alacritty`
- `htop`
- `kitty`
- `fastfetch`
- `gtklock`
- `qt5ct`
- `qt6ct`
- `swaync`
- `swayosd`
- `zsh`
- `MangoHud`
- `spotify-launcher`
- `kanshi`

Also, `eplayerctl` script is required. It is stored in 'bin/eplayerctl' directory and is automatically linked into '~/.local/bin' when using `install.sh` script.
